## üåü Vision

In high school, I worked on web marketing at an online tutoring company and participated in STEAM education activities with an NPO. These experiences helped me discover my passion for education and technology.

Initially, I knew little about IT, but working at Kalytero required me to dive into programming. This journey made me realize the significance of leveraging technology to address social challenges.

At [42 Tokyo](https://42tokyo.jp/), I aim to deepen my technical expertise across various layers of software development. My goal is to actively contribute to solving societal issues through technology, both at Kalytero and in future endeavors.
